About Me

No doubt you’ve found this page by doing a Google search for my name. 

Kimberly began practicing Bikram Yoga in December  2006. 
“I was 31 years old, and I didn’t think anything could make me sweat more than running a marathon 
or taking a spin class! I was wrong! It was very challenging, but I really loved my first class. 
When I would run long distances, I would think, sort out my life, and make plans in my head the whole time.  
When I practiced yoga, I thought it was hard, unique and invaluable how much I had to stay present and
focused throughout. I knew this was a practice I needed, and I kept coming back for more.” 
Bikram Yoga has helped me work through knee pain, sciatica, and other running-related injuries.
Kimberly graduated in Fall 2010 from Bikram Yoga College of India teacher training in San Diego, CA. 
The daily practice is a powerful self-realization tool that can help us love ourselves and others more, f
ind clarity, realize we’re so much stronger and amazing than we ever dreamed possible, and get into good 
physical shape in the process. She believes that once we learn to focus and control the mind, to look 
ourselves square in the eye and truly meditate for a full 90 minutes, we can do ANYTHING we set our minds to. 
Kimberly is grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this process in students’ lives.
